## About Me
Hi, I'm Connor Schweighöfer, an 19-year-old developer with around 4 years of programming experience. My expertise lies in Java and backend development, but I've also worked on a variety of projects including plugins, desktop, and frontend applications.

I developed an interest in Computer Science at the age of 14 by playing Minecraft and creating my own modifications for the game. My focus quickly shifted towards learning Java, and after a few months, I completed the [Java Programming course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) from the University of Helsinki. At the same time, I became active on the [Together Java](https://togetherjava.org/) Discord server. Now, I am an active helper and community lead on the server, which helps me to stay up-to-date with latest technologies.

Throughout the journey as a developer, I have been working on a wide range of projects. I contributed to [TJ-Bot](https://github.com/Together-Java/TJ-Bot), an open-source Discord bot for the Together Java Discord server. Additionally, I have been working on my own little projects like a Minecraft Plugin library called [FrameUI](https://github.com/SquidXTV/FrameUI) and JavaFX projects, including my [thesis](https://squidxtv.me/resources/Thesis%20-%20Two-Body%20Problem.pdf) on the two-body problem.

I am currently studying Applied Computer Science at the FHDW with [adesso SE](https://www.adesso.de/en/) as my partner company. I alternate every three months between working at the company and attending university, allowing me to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Recently, I completed the [Spring Certified Professional](https://spring.academy/paths/spring-certified-professional-2023) course from Spring Academy and plan to take the certification exam in the near future. Additionally, I successfully passed the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam.

Outside of programming, I have an appreciation for nature, spending my free time exploring on my mountain bike. I also enjoy playing football and video games with friends.
