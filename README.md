## About Me
My name is Connor Schweighöfer, and I'm a 19-year-old developer. I recently finished high school with a focus on Math, Physics and Chemistry. Later this year, I will being studying Computer Science at the [FHDW](https://www.fhdw.de/en). My partner company will be [adesso SE](https://www.adesso.de/en/), where I will gain practical experience in fullstack development.

I developed an interest in Computer Science at the age of 14 by playing Minecraft and creating my own modifications and plugins for the game. My focus quickly shifted towards learning Java, and after a few months, I completed the [Java Programming course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) from the University of Helsinki. At the same time, I became active on the [Together Java](https://togetherjava.org/) Discord server. Now, I am an active helper and community lead on the server, which helps me to stay up-to-date with latest technologies.

Throughout my journey as a developer, I have been working on a wide range of projects. I contributed to [TJ-Bot](https://github.com/Together-Java/TJ-Bot), an open-source Discord bot for the Together Java Discord server. Additionally, I have been working on my own little projects like a Minecraft Plugin library called [FrameUI](https://github.com/SquidXTV/FrameUI) and some JavaFX projects, including my [thesis](https://squidxtv.me/resources/Thesis%20-%20Two-Body%20Problem.pdf) on the two-body problem.

Currently, I am becoming more interested in backend development, particularly learning Spring and its ecosystem. I have studied the basics of [Spring in Action, Sixth Edition](https://github.com/SquidXTV/taco-cloud), and I am currently exploring the [Spring Certified Professional](https://spring.academy/paths/spring-certified-professional-2023) course.
