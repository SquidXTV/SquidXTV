## About Me
I'm an 18-year-old developer and high school student from Rinteln, Germany, with a passion for crafting cool and user-friendly apps. 
I've been into computer science for about 4 years now, and it's been an awesome journey so far!

Right now, I'm wrapping up high school, focusing on Math, Physics, and Chemistry, as I couldn't take computer science in school. I'm going to start my computer science studies in 2024.
University sounds like a big adventure, and I can't wait to level up my dev skills there.

## My Journey
I've been lucky to work on all sorts of projects that helped me learn tons of technologies.
One of my favs was helping out with TJ-Bot, a community discord bot for the Together Java discord server. 
I'm a helper and community lead for the Together Java discord and I love being up-to-date and in touch
with other developer

## Minecraft Magic
Lately, I've been diving deep into Minecraft plugins and I am currently working on two plugins called
FrameUI and AuctionHouseUI. 

FrameUI is a library that lets you create interactive in-game "Screens" which consist of multiple item frames
holding maps with a custom renderer. This library will be used in the AuctionHouseUI plugin in the future to
create an auction house which got a real graphical user interface instead of inventory-based gui.
